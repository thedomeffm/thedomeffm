## About me

Full-stack developer obsessed with building clean, well-architected web applications.
I'm a firm believer in following best practices and design patterns.
Proudly bootstrapped a small SaaS that's (slowly but surely) paying some bills.
Currently diving deep into the world of AI, exploring how to integrate the latest advancements into our software.
I strive for honest communication, but always with a dash of humor and a friendly approach.
